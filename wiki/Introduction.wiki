I plan to write detailed instructions soon but this will have to suffice for now.

== Security Restrictions ==

The RestHttpService library uses sockets to overcome the limitations of Flex's HTTPService component. Unfortunately, the Flash security model restricts a Flex application from making socket connections to any server that does not explicitly permit such connections (excluding basic HTTP GET and POST requests). Therefore, in order to make a REST service available to a Flex socket client, the REST server must expose a socket policy file on port 843. This file should be named crossdomain.xml (unless the Security.loadPolicyFile() method is used to load a different file). The policy file is accessed automatically by Flex before it attempts to open a socket. If the policy file is not available or does not grant access to the Flex application's domain, Flex will throw a "Security sandbox violation" error. Here is a very basic example of a crossdomain.xml file that allows access to all domains and ports:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM "http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<cross-domain-policy>
    <allow-access-from domain="*"/>
</cross-domain-policy>
}}}

Here is another policy file example that grants access to port 8080 to all Flex clients originating from the company.com domain:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM "http://www.macromedia.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<cross-domain-policy>
    <allow-access-from domain="*.company.com" to-ports="8080" secure="false"/>
</cross-domain-policy>
}}}

For detailed information regarding the format of the crossdomain.xml file and how to use it, see this article:

[http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_14213&sliceId=2]

Again, this policy file must be available on port 843. A simple way to serve this file is to run a small daemon process on your web server that does nothing more than serve the policy file from this port. You can learn more about how to establish a policy file server here:

[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/socket_policy_files.html]

You can download a free daemon to serve the policy file from here:

== Sample Code ==

To use the RestHttpService component, add it to your library path and invoke it from an MXML application. Here is some sample MXML to help get you started (you can download this sample MXML from the Downloads tab):

            var restService:RestHttpService = new RestHttpService("localhost", 8080);

            //add a listener to be invoked when data is received
            restService.addEventListener(RestHttpService.EVENT_DATA_RECEIVED, dataHandler);

            //add a listener to be invoked when an error occurs
            restService.addEventListener(RestHttpService.EVENT_FAULT, faultHandler);

            restService.doGet("/books/1");

== Limitations ==

This service is under development and, therefore, does not yet support all HTTP features. For example, only text payloads are currently supported. Requests and responses carrying binary data will be supported in a future version. In addition, the HTTPS/TLS/SSL support is in the early stages of development and still experimental.
